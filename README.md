## The Problem

Every browser agent today — OpenAI Operator, Anthropic Computer Use, Google Mariner — takes a screenshot, feeds it to a vision model, and hopes the model can figure out where the buttons are. This costs **10,000-15,000 tokens per page view** and introduces OCR hallucinations, spatial reasoning errors, and mandatory vision model dependencies.

## The Idea

What if the page representation was *text that looks like the page*? A character grid where element density encodes type — buttons render as `████`, inputs as `╔══╗`, links as `▸`, and layout is preserved spatially. Any text model reads it natively. No vision encoder needed.

```
         [1]              [2]  [3]
  
  ╔══[4]═══════════════════════════╗
  ╚════════════════════════════════╝

     [5]         [6]         [7]

     [8]         [9]         [10]

              [11]██████████████
              █ + New Project █
              ██████████████████
```

The model sees spatial layout, element types, and numbered targets in **~1,000 tokens**. It says `{"action": "click", "element": 11}` and the extension executes it.

## Validation

We tested graphic density output on 11 different products — GitHub, ChatGPT, Gmail, Google Docs, Reddit, Namecheap, Convex, Supabase, Cloudflare, and more. A text-only model with **zero instructions** correctly identified every product, located primary actions, and understood visual hierarchy.

Then we benchmarked against WebArena-style tasks:

| Run | Score | Tokens | Time | What Changed |
|-----|-------|--------|------|--------------|
| Run 1 | 0/5 (0%) | 394K | 33 min | Baseline — broken agent loop |
| Run 2 | 2/5 (40%) | 172K | 5.8 min | Prompt + budget fixes only |
| Run 3 | **3/5 (60%)** | **172K** | **10 min** | Read mode — agent can see text content |

0% to 60% in one day. Same token budget. No task-specific tuning.

## Properties

Fourteen properties fall out of the spatial text encoding:

| Property | How |
|----------|-----|
| **No vision model needed** | Any text model reads the character grid natively |
| **Spatial layout** | Elements appear where they are on screen |
| **Action targeting** | Numbered elements resolve to coordinates |
| **10-30x cheaper** | ~1,000 tokens vs ~10,000-15,000 for screenshots |
| **Model-agnostic** | Claude, GPT, Llama, Gemini — anything that reads text |
| **Anti-bot invisible** | Runs in user's real browser via extension, zero fingerprint |
| **Scroll containers** | Independent scrollable regions as first-class elements |
| **State diffable** | Two text grids diff trivially — 90% token reduction per step |
| **Multi-step planning** | Hidden DOM scan reveals entire SPA flows in one shot |
| **Iframe pipelining** | Prefetch next page state, eliminate inter-step latency |
| **Action sandboxing** | Fork state in iframe, preview consequences before committing |
| **Injection resistant** | Non-interactive text compressed away — attack payloads stripped |
| **Cross-platform** | Same technique works with OS accessibility trees (desktop, mobile) |
| **Page type detection** | Heuristic classification from element composition |

## Quick Start

### 1. Load the Extension

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Badgerion/GDG-browser.git
```

1. Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked** → select the cloned folder
4. Navigate to any website → click the extension icon → **Scan Page**

### 2. Set Up the API Bridge

```bash
cd bridge
chmod +x install.sh server.js
./install.sh <your-extension-id>  # ID from chrome://extensions
```

Reload the extension. Test the connection:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:7080/health
```

### 3. Drive It from Python

```bash
pip install requests anthropic
```

```python
from gd_client import GraphicDensity

gd = GraphicDensity()

# See the page
gd.print_state(mode="read")

# Navigate and interact
gd.navigate("https://github.com")
gd.fill(3, "search query")
gd.click(4)

# Read data from the page
state = gd.read()
print(state["content"])   # visible text
print(state["tables"])    # extracted table data
```

---

## How It Works

### The Core Loop

```
1. GET /state?mode=numbered  →  model sees spatial map + element registry
2. Model decides             →  {"action": "click", "element": 11}
3. POST /action              →  extension executes, waits for DOM to settle
4. Returns new state         →  model sees what happened
5. Repeat
```

### Five Render Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Tokens | Use When |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| `full` | Complete page with density typing | ~3,000-5,000 | Initial page understanding |
| `actions_only` | Only interactive elements | ~500-800 | Cheapest navigation |
| `numbered` | Interactive elements with IDs | ~1,000-2,000 | Standard agent operation |
| `numbered_v2` | + action hints, forms, layers | ~1,200-2,500 | Complex UIs with modals |
| `read` | + visible text + table extraction | ~2,000-4,000 | Reading data, finding answers |

### Adaptive Two-Phase Strategy

```
Navigate Phase (numbered mode — cheap, spatial)
  → Click menus, fill search bars, navigate to target page

Read Phase (read mode — rich, content-aware)
  → Extract text, read tables, find specific data values
```

The model switches modes mid-task: `{"action": "switch_mode", "mode": "read"}`

### v0.2 Enhancements

**Interaction hints** — every element shows what actions it supports:
```
[5]  button  "Submit"           click → submit
[12] input   "Search"           fill, clear
[17] link    "Documentation"    click → nav
[22] select  "Country"          select
```

**Form grouping** — elements inside `<form>` tags are linked:
```
[7]  input   "Email"            fill    {form:login}
[8]  input   "Password"         fill    {form:login}
[9]  button  "Sign in"          click → submit  {form:login}
```

**Layer awareness** — modals and overlays are detected:
```
⚠ MODAL ACTIVE — interact with elements 41, 42 first

[41] button  "Cancel"     click     [modal]
[42] button  "Confirm"    click     [modal]
[1]  button  "Menu"       click     [blocked]
```

**Table extraction** — structured data with pagination:
```
── Table 1 (Showing 1-20 of 2,048 results) ──
| Name | Email | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Veronica Costello | veronica@example.com | Active |
| ...
```

## API Reference

The bridge exposes a local HTTP API on `127.0.0.1:7080`:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/state?mode=read` | Page state (map + registry + content) |
| `GET` | `/environment` | Full state + history + page type |
| `POST` | `/action` | Execute action: `{"action":"click","element":5}` |
| `POST` | `/batch` | Execute sequence, stops on first failure |
| `POST` | `/navigate` | Go to URL, returns new state |
| `GET` | `/tabs` | List all open browser tabs |
| `GET` | `/history` | Action history for current tab |
| `DELETE` | `/history` | Clear action history |
| `GET` | `/health` | Connection status |

### Action Types

```json
{"action": "click", "element": 5}
{"action": "fill", "element": 3, "value": "hello"}
{"action": "clear", "element": 3}
{"action": "select", "element": 7, "value": "Option text"}
{"action": "hover", "element": 12}
{"action": "scroll", "direction": "down"}

## Benchmarks

Tested against WebArena-style tasks on a Magento admin panel (multi-step navigation, data retrieval, form interaction):

```
Run 1 → 0%   (0/5)   394K tokens   33 min    broken loop
Run 2 → 40%  (2/5)   172K tokens   5.8 min   prompt fixes
Run 3 → 60%  (3/5)   172K tokens   10 min    read mode (v0.2)
```

**Comparison to screenshot-based agents:**

| Approach | Tokens/step | Vision required | Cost/step |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Screenshot + GPT-4o | 10,000-15,000 | Yes | $0.01-0.04 |
| DOM tree (rtrvr.ai) | 2,000-3,000 | No | $0.003-0.006 |
| **Graphic Density (numbered)** | **800-1,500** | **No** | **$0.001-0.003** |
| **Graphic Density (actions_only)** | **400-800** | **No** | **$0.0005-0.001** |

## Architecture

```
External Process (Python, curl, any language)
  ↕ HTTP (localhost:7080)
bridge/server.js         ← Native messaging host + HTTP server
  ↕ stdin/stdout (Chrome native messaging)
background.js            ← Service worker, tab routing, navigation
  ↕ chrome.tabs.sendMessage
renderer.js              ← Scanner + classifier + renderer + executor
  ↕ DOM / accessibility tree
Web Page
```

### Key Design Decisions

**Extension-based, not CDP.** Chrome Extension APIs are first-class browser citizens — sandboxed execution, no automation fingerprint, session persistence across crashes. CDP (Puppeteer/Playwright) is a debugging backdoor with detectable fingerprints.

**Text output, not images.** Any model that reads text can drive the browser. No vision encoder, no image preprocessing, no OCR. Token cost scales with page complexity, not pixel count.

**Semantic density, not raw DOM.** Elements are classified by role and rendered with visual weight. Buttons are heavy (`████`), inputs have borders (`╔══╗`), links are light (`▸`). The model perceives UI hierarchy from character density without needing CSS or computed styles.
